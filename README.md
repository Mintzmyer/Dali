A widget that tracks time to reference points, like dates and events. 

This project is motivated by my own preoccupation with time relative
to meaningful reference points. It aims to automate questions like:
  - How long has a project been in dev?
  - How many months until a significant anniversary? (Can an alert 
    notify me in time to buy and mail a thoughtful gift?) 
  - What percentage of my 27th birthday has passed? 
  - How many weeks until a project deadline?

It's also a reason to expand my Android app development skills into
widgets, which I suspect are somewhat underutilized by traditional
applications UI/UX. It also helps exercise my project planning, and
agile development skills.
